AMP Optimizer implements [AMP performance best practices](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/optimize_amp?format=websites) and supports [AMP server-side-rendering](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/server-side-rendering?format=websites). By default, it will perform the following optimizations:\n\n- [Server-side render AMP layouts](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/server-side-rendering/).\n- **Automatically import all missing AMP component scripts**.\n- **Automatically add any missing mandatory AMP tags**.\n- Auto detects and preloads hero images from amp-img, amp-iframe, amp-video, or amp-video-iframe.\n- Remove the AMP boilerplate (when possible).\n- Remove not needed whitespace.\n- Extract and move CSS keyframe animations to the bottom of the page.\n- Optimize AMP framework and custom font loading\n- Generate CSP for inlined [`amp-script`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-script/) code.\n\nThe performance optimizations can improve page rendering times by up to 50%. You can read more about the potential performance gains in this [blog post](https://blog.amp.dev/2018/10/08/how-to-make-amp-even-faster/). To give it a try, check out [the online playground](https://toolbox-optimizer.glitch.me/).\n\n**Good to know:**\n\n- AMP Optimizer will produce valid AMP.\n- AMP Optimizer can be used in combination with [AMP Packager](https://github.com/ampproject/amppackager) to create SXGs.\n\n## Usage\n\n### API\n\nInstall via:\n\n```\nnpm install @ampproject/toolbox-optimizer\n```\n\nMinimal usage:\n\n```js\nconst AmpOptimizer = require('@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer');\n\nconst ampOptimizer = AmpOptimizer.create();\n\nconst originalHtml = `\n<!doctype html>\n<html ⚡>\n  ...\n</html>`;\n\nampOptimizer.transformHtml(originalHtml).then(optimizedHtml => {\n  console.log(optimizedHtml);\n});\n```\n\nYou can find a sample implementation [here](/packages/optimizer/demo/simple). If you're using express to serve your site, you can use the [AMP Optimizer Middleware](/packages/optimizer-express).\n\n### CLI\n\nAMP Optimizer can be used via the [AMP Toolbox CLI](/packages/cli/README.md):\n\n```shell\nnpm install @ampproject/toolbox-cli -g\namp optimize myFile.html\n```\n\nor run without installation via `npx`:\n\n```shell\nnpx @ampproject/toolbox-cli optimize myFile.html\n```\n\n### Options\n\nOptions are passed when creating a new AMP Optimizer instance:\n\n```js\nconst ampOptimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  verbose: true\n});\n...\n```\n\nAvailable options are:\n\n- [autoAddMandatoryTags](#autoaddmandatorytags)\n- [autoExtensionImport](#autoextensionimport)\n- [extensionVersions](#extensionversions)\n- [fetch](#fetch)\n- [format](#format)\n- [imageBasePath](#imagebasePath)\n- [imageOptimizer](#imageoptimizer)\n- [lts](#lts)\n- [markdown](#markdown)\n- [minify](#minify)\n- [preloadHeroImage](#preloadheroimage)\n- [verbose](#verbose)\n\n#### `autoAddMandatoryTags`\n\nAutomatically inject any missing markup required by AMP.\n\n- name: `autoAddMandatoryTags`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `true`\n- used by: [AddMandatoryTags](lib/transformers/AddMandatoryTags.js)\n\n#### `autoExtensionImport`\n\nAutomatically import any missing AMP Extensions (e.g. amp-carousel).\n\n- name: `autoExtensionImport`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `true`\n- used by: [AutoExtensionImport](lib/transformers/AutoExtensionImporter.js)\n\n#### `extensionVersions`\n\nSpecify version numbers to use for automatically imported Extensions. If not defined, default to latest.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst ampOptimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  extensionVersions: {\n    \"amp-twitter\": \"0.1\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\n- name: `extensionVersions`\n- valid options: `OBJECT`\n- default: `{}`\n- used by: [AutoExtensionImport](lib/transformers/AutoExtensionImporter.js)\n\n#### `format`\n\nSpecifies the AMP format of the input file. Defaults to `AMP`.\n\n- name: `format`\n- valid options: `[AMP|AMP4EMAIL|AMP4ADS]`\n- default: `AMP`\n- used by: [AutoExtensionImport](lib/transformers/AutoExtensionImporter.js), [AddMandatoryTags](lib/transformers/AddMandatoryTags.js)\n\n#### `experimentEsm`\n\nEnable [JavaScript Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) support for AMP runtime and components. AMP Optimizer will generate module/nonmodule script imports for AMP runtime and components:\n\n```\n<script async nomodule src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js\"></script>\n<script async src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.mjs\" type=\"module\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n```\n\n**Warning: this will result in invalid AMP pages.**\n\n- name: `experimentEsm`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `false`\n- used by: [RewriteAmpUrls](lib/transformers/RewriteAmpUrls.js)\n\n#### `imageBasePath`\n\nSpecifies a base path used to resolve an image during build,\nthis can be a file system path or URL prefix. You can also pass a function\n`(imgSrc, params) => '../img/' + imgSrc` for dynamically calculating the image path.\n\n- name: `imageBasePath`\n- valid options: `STRING|FUNCTION`\n- default: undefined\n- used by: [Markdown](lib/transformers/Markdown.js)\n\n#### `imageOptimizer`\n\nEnable automated image `srcset` generation by providing a function for calculating `srcset` URLs for a given image `src`. The function should return a URL pointing to a version of the `src` image with the given `width`. If no image is available, it should return a falsy value.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst ampOptimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  imageOptimizer: (src, width) => `${src}?width=${width}`\n});\n```\n\n- name: `imageOptimizer`\n- valid options: `FUNCTION`\n- default: undefined\n- used by: [OptimizeImages](lib/transformers/OptimizeImages.js)\n\n#### `lts`\n\nUse [long-term stable URLs](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/contributing/lts-release.md) for downloading the AMP runtime and components.\n\n- name: `lts`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `false`\n- used by: [RewriteAmpUrls](lib/transformers/RewriteAmpUrls.js)\n\n#### `markdown`\n\nThis transformer adds out-of-the-box markdown support. This allows\nusing AMP Optimizer to convert HTML documents created from Markdown\nfiles into valid AMP. A typical conversion flow would be:\n\nREADME.md => HTML => AMP Optimizer => valid AMP\n\nThe only thing this transformer does is converting `<img>` tags into\neither `amp-img` or `amp-anim` tags. All other Markdown features are\nalready supported by AMP. The transformer will try to resolve image\ndimensions from the actual files. Images larger than 320px will automatically\nget an intrinsic layout. For image detection to work, an optional dependency\n`probe-image-size` needs to be installed via NPM.\n\n- name: `markdown`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `false`\n- used by: [Markdown](lib/transformers/Markdown.js)\n\n#### `minify`\n\nMinifies the generated HTML output and inlined CSS.\n\n- name: `minify`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `true`\n- used by: [MinifyHtml](lib/transformers/MinifyHtml.js), [SeparateKeyframes](lib/transformers/SeparateKeyframes.js)\n\n#### `preloadHeroImage`\n\nEnables hero image optimization. Hero images will either be auto detected or you can explicitly mark these by adding the `data-hero` attribute:\n\n```\n<amp-img data-hero src=\"foo.jpg\" ...>\n```\n\nThe maximum number of hero images that can be marked up using `data-hero` is `2`.\n\nIf no `data-hero` attribute is present, AMP optimizer auto-detects hero images for `amp-img`, `amp-iframe`, `amp-video`, or `amp-video-iframe` and injects a `link rel=preload`. Image preload links will only be generated if there is none already existing. For `amp-img` elements, it will also server-side render the `img` element inside the `amp-img` element. This greatly improves image rendering performance and reduces the [largest contentful paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP) metric from [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).\n\n- name: `preloadHeroImage`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `true`\n- used by: [PreloadHeroImage](lib/transformers/PreloadHeroImage.js)\n\n#### `verbose`\n\nEnable verbose mode with more detailed logging output.\n\n- name: `verbose`\n- valid options: `[true|false]`\n- default: `false`\n\n## Features\n\n### Image optimization\n\nAMP Optimizer helps you serve optimized images. For this to work, you need to provide a function that maps an image `src` to a resized `srcset` source value. The image resizing needs to either happen at build time (e.g. for static sites) or via a image hosting service such as [thumbor](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor).\n\nHere is an example implementation that appends the image width to the `src`:\n\n```js\nconst ampOptimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  // parameters are the amp-img `src` and the `width` of the to be generated srcset source value\n  imageOptimizer: (src, width) => {\n    // we cannot rename if the image does not have a file extension\n    const index = src.lastIndexOf('.');\n    if (index === -1) {\n      // return null means we won't generate a srcset source value for this width\n      return null;\n    }\n    const prefix = src.substring(0, index);\n    const postfix = src.substring(index, src.length);\n    return `${prefix}.${width}w${postfix}`;\n  };\n})\n```\n\nUsing this implementation, AMP Optimizer will transform the following `amp-img` declarations:\n\n```html\n<!-- Injects srcset for responsive layout -->\n<amp-img src=\"image1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"800\" layout=\"responsive\"></amp-img>\n<!-- Ignores existing srcset -->\n<amp-img layout=fill srcset=\"image-1x.png 1x,\n                             image-2x.png 2x\"></amp-img>\n```\n\ninto:\n\n```html\n<!-- Injects srcset for responsive layout -->\n<amp-img src=\"image1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"800\" layout=\"responsive\" srcset=\"image1.470w.png 470w, image1.820w.png 820w, image1.1440w.png 1440w\"></amp-img>\n<!-- Ignores existing srcset -->\n<amp-img layout=\"fill\" srcset=\"image-1x.png 1x,\n                               image-2x.png 2x\"></amp-img>\n```\n\n**Important** when using `layout=responsive` use the `width` and `height` attribute to specify the minimum image dimensions. For example, for a full-bleed hero image on mobile, specify the width as`width=320`.\n\n### Auto add incomplete markup\n\nIt's possible to pass incomplete documents and AMP Optimizer will add any\nmissing tags and extension imports required by a valid AMP document.\n\n```js\nconst originalHtml = `\n  <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n  <amp-twitter width=\"375\"\n               height=\"472\"\n               layout=\"responsive\"\n               data-tweetid=\"1182321926473162752\">\n  </amp-twitter>\n`;\n\n// you can pass the canonical URL, default is `.`\nconst opts = {\n  canonical: '/example.html'\n}\nampOptimizer.transformHtml(originalHtml, opts).then((optimizedHtml) => {\n  // optimizedHtml will be a valid AMP document\n  console.log(optimizedHtml);\n});\n```\n\n### Automated Markdown conversion\n\nAMP Optimizer supports converting Markdown to AMPHTML. A typical conversion flow would be:\n\n```\nREADME.md => HTML => AMP Optimizer => valid AMP\n```\n\nThe AMP Optimizer converts `<img>` tags into `<amp-img>` or `<amp-anim>` tags when in Markdown mode. Enable Markdown mode via `markdown : true`. AMP Optimizer will try to resolve image dimensions from the actual files. Images wider than 320px will automatically get an `intrinsic` layout.\n\nAll other Markdown features are already supported by AMP.\n\nYou can pass an additional option `imageBasePath` to specify a base path used to resolve an image during build, this can be a file system path or URL prefix.\n\n**Important:** for image size detection to work, an optional dependency\n`probe-image-size` needs to be installed via NPM.\n\n```shell\nnpm install probe-image-size --save-dev\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst AmpOptimizer = require('@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer');\nconst md = require('markdown-it')({\n  // don't sanitize html if you want to support AMP components in Markdown\n  html: true,\n});\n\n// enable markdown mode\nconst ampOptimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  markdown: true,\n});\n\nconst markdown = `\n# Markdown 🤯\n\nHere is an image declared in Markdown syntax:\n\n![A random image](https://unsplash.it/800/600).\n\nYou can directly declare AMP components:\n\n<amp-twitter width=\"375\"\n             height=\"472\"\n             layout=\"responsive\"\n             data-tweetid=\"1182321926473162752\">\n</amp-twitter>\n\nAny missing extensions will be automatically imported.\n`;\n\nconst html = md.render(markdown);\n\nconst amphtml = await ampOptimizer.transformHtml(html, {\n  canonical: filePath,\n});\n```\n\nYou can find a working sample [here](/packages/optimizer/demo/markdown).\n\n## Extending AMP Optimizer with custom transformations\n\nAMP Optimizer supports custom HTML transformations:\n\n```js\nconst AmpOptimizer = require('@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer');\nconst {createElement, firstChildByTag, appendChild} = AmpOptimizer.NodeUtils;\n\nclass CustomTransformer {\n  constructor(config) {\n    this.log_ = config.log.tag('CUSTOM');\n  }\n  transform(tree, params) {\n    this.log_.info('Running custom transformation for ', params.filePath);\n    const html = firstChildByTag(tree, 'html');\n    if (!html) return;\n    const head = firstChildByTag(html, 'head');\n    if (!head) return;\n    const desc = createElement('meta', {\n      name: 'description',\n      content: 'this is just a demo',\n    });\n    appendChild(head, desc);\n  }\n}\n\n// it's best to run custom transformers first\nconst customTransformations = [CustomTransformer, ...AmpOptimizer.TRANSFORMATIONS_AMP_FIRST];\n\n// pass custom transformers when creating the optimizer\nconst optimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  transformations: customTransformations,\n});\n// you can add custom parameters on a per document basis\nconst transformedHtml = await optimizer.transformHtml(html, {\n  filePath,\n});\n```\n\nCheckout [the samples](/packages/optimizer/demo/simple/index.js) to learn how to customize AMP Optimizer.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Make sure to enable AMP Boilerplate removal\n\nThe biggest performance gain results from [removing the AMP boilerplate code](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/server-side-rendering/#why-is-it-faster?). However, under some circumstances it's not possible to remove the boilerplate code:\n\n- if the`amp-experiment`, `amp-story` or `amp-dynamic-css-classes` components are used ([code](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/62a9eab084ccd800d80a371e2cb29cd4f9e8576a/src/render-delaying-services.js#L39-L43)).\n\nTo find out, why the AMP boilerplate could not be removed, enable `verbose` mode:\n\n```js\n// globally\nconst optimizer = ampOptimizer.create({\n  verbose: true\n} );\n```\n\n... or for individual pages:\n\n```js\n// per transformation\nampOptimizer.transformHtml(originalHtml, {\n  verbose: true\n})\n```\n\n### Transform AMP pages at build time if possible\n\nApplying the transformations to an AMP file consumes additional server resources. Also, since the entire file is needed to apply the transformations, it also becomes impossible to stream the response while applying it. In order to avoid server overhead, if the set of AMP files to be transformed is known in advance, transformations should be run at build time.\n\n### Cache transformed AMPs at runtime\n\nMost websites have a more dynamic nature though and are not able to apply the transformations statically. For such cases it is possible to run the transformations after AMP pages are rendered, e.g. in an Express middleware. In that case, to achieve best performance, it's best to cache transformed pages for subsequent requests. Caching can take place on the CDN level, on the site's internal infrastructure (eg: Memcached), or even on the server itself, if the set of pages is small enough to fit in memory.\n\n### Regenerate pages at least once a week\n\nAMP Optimizer inlines CSS styles required by AMP. To make sure, that the inlined CSS stays in sync with the latest AMP release, we recommend to re-generate pages at least once a weekOut-of-sync CSS will not break your page, but it could theoretically cause AMP components to briefly appear with the \"wrong\" styles, such as being visible when they should be hidden. The good news is that these glitches will only be temporary, because as soon as the AMP JS starts, it will check the inlined CSS and update it if required.\n\n## Experimental Features\n\n**Warning: these features are experimental and might result in invalid AMP pages.**\n\n### Paired AMP\n\nWhen using experimental features resulting in invalid AMP it's best to setup paired AMP mode. Paired AMP mode will add `<link rel=amphtml href=${ampUrl}>` to the transformed page, were `ampUrl` needs to point to the valid version of this page.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst optimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  transformations: AmpOptimizer.TRANSFORMATIONS_PAIRED_AMP,\n});\nconst ampFilePath = filePath.substring(1, filePath.length)\n    .replace('.html', '.amp.html');\nconst transformedHtml = await optimizer.transformHtml(html, {\n  // needed to calculate the `<link rel=amphtml href=${ampUrl}>`\n  ampUrl: ampFilePath,\n});\n```\n\n### Versioned AMP Runtime\n\nThe `ampRuntimeVersion` parameter will rewrite all AMP runtime and extension imports to the specified version. For example:\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js\n```\n\nwill be replaced with:\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.ampproject.org/rtv/001515617716922/v0.js\n```\n\nVersioning the AMP runtime URLs has one main benefit: versioned AMP runtime URLs are served with a longer max-age than the unversioned ones. This means AMP pages served with versioned AMP runtime benefit from better browser caching.\n\n**Important:** when using versioned AMP runtime URLs make sure to invalidate all caches whenever a new AMP runtime is released. This is to ensure that your AMP pages always use the latest version of the AMP runtime.\n\nYou can use [@ampproject/toolbox-runtime-version](/packages/runtime-version) to retrieve the latest version of the AMP runtime. Here is a sample to apply the optimizations including versioning the URLs:\n\n```js\nconst ampOptimizer = require('@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer');\nconst ampRuntimeVersion = await runtimeVersion.currentVersion();\n\n// The input string\nconst originalHtml = `\n<!doctype html>\n<html ⚡>\n...\n`\n\n// Additional options can be passed as the second argument\nconst optimizedHtml = await ampOptimizer.transformHtml(originalHtml, {\n  ampUrl: 'canonical.amp.html',\n  ampRuntimeVersion: ampRuntimeVersion\n});\n\nconsole.log(optimizedHtml);\n```\n\n### Blurry image placeholders\n\nAdd placeholders for `amp-img` and `amp-video` posters. The placeholders are blurry versions of the corresponding original source. The blur will be displayed as the `<amp-img>` is rendering, and will fade out once the element is loaded. The current requirements of appending a blurry placeholder is for the element is to be a JPEG that is either responsive or a poster for an `amp-video`.\n\n**Important: blurry image placeholder computation is computationally expensive. Make sure to only use it for static or cached pages.**\n\nThis transformer supports the following options:\n\n- `blurredPlaceholders`: Enables blurry image placeholder generation. Default is `false`.\n- `imageBasePath`: specifies a base path used to resolve an image during build.\n- `maxBlurredPlaceholders`: Specifies the max number of blurred images. Defaults to 5.\n- `blurredPlaceholdersCacheSize`: Specifies the max number of blurred images to be cached\n  to avoid expensive recalculation. Set to 0 if caching should be disabled. Set to -1 if\n  all placeholders should be cached (good for static sites). Defaults to 30.\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nconst optimizer = AmpOptimizer.create({\n  // blurry image placeholders are currently not considered valid AMP\n  // hence it's recommended to setup paired AMP mode when enabling this feature.\n  transformations: AmpOptimizer.TRANSFORMATIONS_PAIRED_AMP,\n  blurredPlaceholders: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Self-hosted AMP components\n\nIt's possible to rewrite the AMP framework and component imports to a different domain than `cdn.ampproject.org`.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst ampOptimizer = require('@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer');\n\n// The input string\nconst originalHtml = `\n<!doctype html>\n<html ⚡>\n...\n`\n\n// Additional options can be passed as the second argument\nconst optimizedHtml = await ampOptimizer.transformHtml(originalHtml, {\n  ampUrl: 'canonical.amp.html',\n  // this will rewrite https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js to /amp/v0.js\n  ampUrlPrefix: '/amp'\n});\n\nconsole.log(optimizedHtml);\n```\n\n### Fallback API for amp-geo\n\nIdeally, when self-hosting the AMP framework, `amp-geo-0.1.js` should be patched at delivery time to replace `{{AMP_ISO_COUNTRY_HOTPATCH}}` with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code where the request originated ([reference](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/spec/amp-cache-guidelines.md#guidelines-adding-a-new-cache-to-the-amp-ecosystem)). If your host does not have this capability, you can instead rely on a web API to return the country at runtime. The web API must be secure (HTTPS), adhere to [AMP CORS guidelines](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-caches-and-cors/amp-cors-requests/), and return JSON in the following format:\n\n```js\n{\"country\": \"de\"}\n```\n\nwhere in this example, `de` is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for Germany.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst ampOptimizer = require('@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer');\n\n// The input string\nconst originalHtml = `\n<!doctype html>\n<html ⚡>\n...\n`;\n\nconst optimizedHtml = await ampOptimizer.transformHtml(originalHtml, {\n  // this will instruct amp-geo to fetch the user's country from an API\n  // which returns JSON in format: {\"country\": \"de\"}\n  geoApiUrl: 'https://example.com/geo'\n});\n\nconsole.log(optimizedHtml);\n```\n\n## Development & Testing\n\nAMP Optimizer uses a snapshot based testing approach. To execute the tests, run in the project root:\n\n```shell\nnpm run test:node\n```\n\nTransformer tests are located in:\n\n```\n- spec/transformers/valid/TransformerName/test-name/\n    expected_output.html\n    input.html\n```\n\nThe transformation input is defined in `input.html`, whereas `expected_output.html` contains the expected\noutcome of the transformation. Don't edit `expected_output.html` manually, instead, after changing\na transformer implementation, run:\n\n```shell\nnpm run test:optimizer:snapshot\n```\n\nto store a new snapshot version in `expected_output.html`."

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It provides components and context that make your\nform fields accessible by default.\n\n- **FormControl** - the top level component that provides context.\n- **FormLabel** - the visible form control label.\n- **FormHelperText** - the form control's assistive text that guides the user.\n  If added, it hides when there's an error in the field.\n- **FormErrorMessage** - the form control's error feedback. If there's a help\n  text visible when the control is invalid, it replaces the help text, to\n  prevent content shift.\n- **FormErrorIcon** - an icon that indicates the error state for colorblind\n  users.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nyarn add @chakra-ui/form-control\n\n# or\n\nnpm install @chakra-ui/form-control\n```\n\n## Import component\n\n```jsx\nimport {\n  FormControl,\n  FormLabel,\n  FormErrorMessage,\n  FormHelperText,\n  FormErrorIcon,\n} from \"@chakra-ui/form-control\"\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nThe `FormControl` component automatically provides the `id` for the input\ncomponent to be fully accessible.\n\n### With Input\n\n```jsx\n<FormControl>\n  // automatically gets `htmlFor`\n  <FormLabel>First name:</FormLabel>\n  // automatically gets `id` and `aria-*` properties\n  <Input placeholder=\"Enter your first name...\" />\n  // automatically gets `id` and hides if `isInvalid` is passed to `FormControl`\n  <FormHelperText>Keep your first name short</FormHelperText>\n  // automatically gets `id` and shows if `isInvalid` is passed to `FormControl`\n  <FormErrorMessage>First name is invalid</FormErrorMessage>\n</FormControl>\n```\n\n### With Checkbox group\n\n```jsx\n<FormControl as=\"fieldset\">\n  <FormLabel as=\"legend\">Who is better:</FormLabel>\n  <CheckboxGroup>\n    <Checkbox>Naruto</Checkbox>\n    <Checkbox>Boruto</Checkbox>\n  </CheckboxGroup>\n  <FormErrorMessage>C'mon! You must select one</FormErrorMessage>\n</FormControl>\n```\n\n## Focus, Invalid and Disabled States\n\n- When the `Input` component receives focus, it notifies the `FormControl` and\n  adds `data-focus` on the `FormLabel`. Simply pass `_focus` to the `FormLabel`\n  to style this state.\n\n- If `isInvalid` is passed to the `FormControl`, it notifies the `Input` and\n  adds `data-invalid` to the `FormLabel` so you can change the styles of the\n  label.\n\n- If `isDisabled` is passed to the `FormControl`, it makes the `Input` disabled,\n  and adds `data-disabled` to the `FormLabel` so you can change the styles of\n  the label.\n\n## Changing the required indicator\n\nTo change the required indicator beside the `FormLabel`, simply pass the\n`indicator` prop and set it to your custom indicator components.\n\n```jsx\n<FormControl as=\"fieldset\">\n  <FormLabel as=\"legend\" indicator={CustomIndicator}>\n    Who is better:\n  </FormLabel>\n  <CheckboxGroup>\n    <Checkbox>Naruto</Checkbox>\n    <Checkbox>Boruto</Checkbox>\n  </CheckboxGroup>\n  <FormErrorMessage>C'mon! You must select one</FormErrorMessage>\n</FormControl>\n```\n\n## Adding a Visual Icon\n\n```jsx\n<FormControl\n  label=\"Tell us about yourself:\"\n  helpText=\"Keep it short and sweet!\"\n  errorText=\"C'mon! You must select one\"\n>\n  <InputGroup>\n    <Input paddingRight=\"32px\" />\n    <InputRightElement>\n      <FormErrorIcon />\n    </InputRightElement>\n  </InputGroup>\n</FormControl>\n```"

For example, autocomplete, select, etc.\n\nTo achieve this, pass the `matchWidth` option and set it to `true`\n\n```jsx\nconst { popper, reference, arrow, transformOrigin } = usePopper({\n  placement: \"right-start\",\n  matchWidth: true,\n})\n```\n\n### Adding transition\n\nWhen add transitions to a popper component, it is usually advised to apply\npopper and transition to different elements.\n\n```jsx\n// 1.

Chakra UI contains a set of polished React components\n  that work out of the box.\n\n- Flexible & composable. Chakra UI components are built on top of a React UI\n  Primitive for endless composability.\n\n- Accessible. Chakra UI components follows the WAI-ARIA guidelines\n  specifications.\n\n- Dark Mode 😍: All components are dark mode compatible.\n\n## Looking for the documentation?\n\nhttps://chakra-ui.com\n\n## Installing Chakra UI\n\n⚡️Chakra UI is made up of multiple components and tools which you can import\none by one. All you need to do is install the `@chakra-ui/react` package:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add @chakra-ui/react\n# or\n$ npm install --save @chakra-ui/react\n```\n\n# Getting set up\n\nTo start using the components, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Wrap your application in a `ThemeProvider` provided by **@chakra-ui/react**\n\n```jsx\nimport { ThemeProvider, ColorModeProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\nconst App = ({ children }) => (\n  <ThemeProvider>\n    <ColorModeProvider>{children}</ColorModeProvider>\n  </ThemeProvider>\n)\n```\n\n`ColorModeProvider` is a context that provides light mode and dark mode values\nto the components. It also comes with a function to toggle between light/dark\nmode.\n\n2. Now you can start using components like so!:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\nconst App = () => <Button>I just consumed some ⚡️Chakra!</Button>\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nFeel like contributing? That's awesome! We have a\n[contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to help guide you.\n\nThe components to be built come from the\n[Aria Practices Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1).\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people\n([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/segunadebayo\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6916170?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Segun Adebayo\"/><br /><sub><b>Segun Adebayo</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=segunadebayo\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"#maintenance-segunadebayo\" title=\"Maintenance\">🚧</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=segunadebayo\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#example-segunadebayo\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#design-segunadebayo\" title=\"Design\">🎨</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/tioluwani94\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11310046?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Tioluwani Kolawole\"/><br /><sub><b>Tioluwani Kolawole</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=tioluwani94\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#example-tioluwani94\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#maintenance-tioluwani94\" title=\"Maintenance\">🚧</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the\n[all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors)\nspecification.

We've seen CSS architectures like BEM,\nSMACSS, etc, and frameworks like theme-ui, and Tailwind CSS.\n\nWhile these solutions work great, we think there still a sheer amount of work\nrequired to create a fully customizable, theme-aware component.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Chakra Elements\n\nChakra provides enhanced JSX elements that can be styled directly via props, or\ncan accept the common `sx` prop for custom styles.\n\nWe'll provide a chakra function, just like styled-component. Users can create\nany component using the `chakra.[element]`. The resulting component will be a\nstyled component and have all system props.\n\n```jsx\n<chakra.button bg=\"green.200\" _hover={{ bg: \"green.300\" }}>\n  Click me\n</chakra.button>\n\n<chakra.h1 fontSize=\"lg\"> Heading </chakra.h1>\n\n// create your own box\nconst Box = chakra.div\n\n// you can still use the `as` prop\n<Box as=\"h1\">This is my box</Box>\n\n// for custom components\nconst ChakraPowered = chakra(YourComponent)\n\n// TS: chakra will infer the types of Link and\n// make it available in props\n<chakra.a as={Link} to=\"/home\"> Click me</chakra.a>\n```\n\n### Chakra Component API\n\nA way to define themable components in chakra. We believe most re-usable, atomic\ncomponents have the following modifiers:\n\n- Size: It has different size variations (small, medium, large)\n- Variant: It has different visual style (outline, solid, ghost)\n- Color scheme (Optional): For a given variant, it can have several color\n  scheme. For example, an outline button with a red color scheme.\n- Color mode (Optional): Components also change their visual styles based on the\n  user preferred color mode (light or dark)\n\nOur goal with this component API to design a common interface to style any\ncomponent give these characteristics. Here's how it works:\n\n```jsx\n// 1. create a component schema in your theme\nconst theme = {\n\tcolors: {\n    green: {\n      light: \"#dfdfdf\",\n      normal: \"#dfdfdf\",\n      dark: \"#d566Df\",\n      darker: \"#dfd56f\"\n    },\n\t\tblue: {}\n  },\n  components: {\n    Button: {\n      defaultProps: {\n        variant: \"solid\",\n        size: \"md\",\n\t\t\t\tcolorScheme: \"blue\"\n      },\n      variants: {\n\t\t\t\t// props has colorScheme, colorMode (light mode or dark mode)\n        solid: props => ({\n          bg: `${props.colorScheme}.normal`,\n          color: \"white\",\n        }),\n        outline: {\n          border: \"2px\",\n          borderColor: \"green.normal\"\n        }\n      },\n      sizes: {\n        sm: {\n          padding: 20,\n          fontSize: 12\n        },\n        md: {\n          padding: 40,\n          fontSize: 15\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n// 2. create or import Button from chakra-ui\nimport { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\n// or your own button\nconst Button = chakra(\"button\", { themeKey: \"Button\" })\n\n// 3. use the button. It'll have the visual props defined in defaultProps\n<Button>Click me</Button>\n\n// 4. override the defaultProps\n<Button variant=\"outline\" colorScheme=\"green\">Click me</Button>\n```"

Each variant comes it\ndifferent color schemes.\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs variant=\"enclosed\" colorScheme=\"red\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```\n\n### Manually Activated Tabs\n\nBy default, `Tabs` are activated automatically. This means when you use the\narrow keys to change tabs, the tab is activated and focused.\n\nThe content of a `TabPanel` should ideally be preloaded. However, if switching\nto a tab panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, there might\nbe some notable latency and this might affect the experience for keyboard and\nscreen reader users.\n\nIn this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, it moves focus\nwithout activating the tabs. With focus on a specifc tab, users can activate a\ntab by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs isManual variant=\"enclosed\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```\n\n### Tab sizes\n\nYou can change the size of the tab by passing `size` prop. We support 3 sizes\n`sm`, `md`, `lg`\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs size=\"md\" variant=\"enclosed\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```"

I cannot be duplicated\" })\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Update a toast\n\nWhen you update a toast, the toast options and the content are inherited but\ndon't worry you can update them.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from \"react\"\nimport useToast from \"@chakra-ui/toast\"\n\nconst Update = () => {\n  const toast = useToast()\n\n  const id = React.useRef(null)\n\n  const notify = () => {\n    id.current = toast({\n      title: \"Chidori is not available!\",\n      duration: null,\n    })\n  }\n\n  const update = () => {\n    toast.update(id.current, {\n      title: \"Sharingan is all you have!\",\n      status: \"success\",\n      duration: 5000,\n    })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={notify}>Notify</button>\n      <button onClick={update}>Update</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent"

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be\n  added to the result to make it positive\n\n### Postfixes\n\nThe only available postfix at the moment is:\n\n* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript\n  Number. Decimals are not supported.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`\n* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value\n* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13\n\n## Instructions\n\nPrefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be\neither `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).\n\n### Utilities\n\n* `a.clone()` - clone number\n* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes\n* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)\n* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)\n* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero\n  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding\n* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,\n  which must behave like an `Array`\n* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For\n  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:\n  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`\n* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied\n* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits\n  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)\n* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied\n* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative\n* `a.isEven()` - no comments\n* `a.isOdd()` - no comments\n* `a.isZero()` - no comments\n* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)\n  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)\n* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width\n* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width\n* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance\n\n### Arithmetics\n\n* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)\n* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)\n* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)\n* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`\n* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)\n* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)\n* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division\n\n### Bit operations\n\n* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced\n  with `andn` in future)\n* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`\n* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set\n* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)\n* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number\n* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)\n\n### Reduction\n\n* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD\n* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)\n* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`\n\n## Fast reduction\n\nWhen doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to\nuse some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm\nfor [Mersenne Prime][1].\n\n### Reduction context\n\nTo enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(num);\n```\nwhere `num` is just a BN instance.\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(primeName);\n```\n\nWhere `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:\n\n* `'k256'`\n* `'p224'`\n* `'p192'`\n* `'p25519'`\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.mont(num);\n```\n\nTo reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than\n`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.\n\n### Converting numbers\n\nBefore performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted\nto it. Usually, this means that one should:\n\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\n\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\n\nHere is how to convert them back:\n\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n\n### Red instructions\n\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected.

More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Most of\nthe curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective\nor extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.\n\nAll operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is\nprovided by [hash.js][2]\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both\n  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for\n  node)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2014.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling"

Some               *\n*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\n*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *\n*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *\n*                                                                      *\n************************************************************************\n\n8. Litigation\n-------------\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n-------------------------------------------\n\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n  License, v. 2.0.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.\n\nIn case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [{\n      test: /\\.js$/,\n      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n    }]\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By default it might be prevented. However - pinch and zoom might break \"scroll isolation\", and __disabled by default__.\n- `[noIsolation=false]` - disables outer event capturing. Event capturing is React friendly and unlikely be a problem.\nBut if you are using _shadowbox_ of some sort - you dont need it.\n- `[inert=false]` - ☠️(be careful) disables events the rest of page completely using `pointer-events` except the Lock(+shards). \nReact portals not friendly, might lead to production issues. Enable only for __rare__ cases, when you have to disable scrollbars somewhere on the page(except body, Lock and shards).  \n- `[forwardProps]` - will forward all props to the `children`\n- `[className]` - className for an internal div\n- `[removeScrollBar]` - to control scroll bar removal. Set to false, if you prefer to keep it (wheel and touch scroll is still disabled).\n\n# Size\n- (🧩 full) 1.7kb after compression (excluding tslib).\n---\n- (👁 UI) __400b__, visual elements only\n- (🚗 sidecar) 1.5kb, side effects\n```js\nimport {sidecar} from \"react-remove-scroll\";\nimport {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll/UI';\n\nconst sidecar = sidecar(() => import('react-remove-scroll/sidecar'));\n\n<RemoveScroll sideCar={sidecar}>\n  Will load logic from a sidecar when needed\n</RemoveScroll>  \n```\n\n> Consider setting `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` on a document level for a proper mobile experience.\n\n## Internal div\nBut default RemoveScroll will create a div to handle and capture events.\nYou may specify `className` for it, if you need, or __remove it__.\n\nThe following code samples will produce the same output\n```js\n<RemoveScroll className=\"scroll\">\n  Only this content would be scrollable\n</RemoveScroll>\n```\n\n```js\n<RemoveScroll forwardProps>\n  <div className=\"scroll\"> //RemoveScroll will inject props to this div\n    Only this content would be scrollable\n  </div>\n</RemoveScroll> \n```\nPick the first one if you don't need a second.\n\n## Position:fixed elements\nTo properly size these elements please add a special className to them.\n```jsx\nimport {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll';\n\n// to make \"width: 100%\"\n<div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.fullWidth)} />\n\n// to make \"right:0\"\n<div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.zeroRight)} />\n```\nSee [react-remove-scroll-bar](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll-bar) documentation for details.\n\n## More than one lock\nWhen stacked more is active (default) only one (last) component would be active.\n\n## Over isolation\nThat could happen - \nyou disable scroll on the body, \nyou are suppressing all scroll and wheel events,\nand you are ghosting the rest of the page by the `inert` prop.\n\nOnly something inside Lock does exists for the browser, and that might be less than you expected.\n\nDont forget about `shard`, dont forget - `inert` is not portals friendly, dont forget - you dont need over isolation in most of the cases.\n\n> just be careful! \n\n# Performance\nTo do the job this library setup _non_ passive event listener. Chrome dev tools would complain about it, as a \nperformance no-op.\n\nWe have to use synchronous scroll/touch handler, and it may affect scrolling performance.\n\nConsider using `noIsolation` mode, if you have large scrollable areas.\n\n# Supported React versions\n- v1 supports React 15/16\n- v2 requires 16.8.0+ (hooks)\n\n# Scroll-Locky\nThis is a refactoring of another library - [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky) -\nto make package smaller and more react-portals friendly.\n\n## See also\n - [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) - Finite Modal creator (uses Scroll-Locky) underneath.\n - [react-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-locky) - React event canceler\n - [react-scrolllock](https://github.com/jossmac/react-scrolllock) - React scroll lock\n - [scroll-lock](https://github.com/FL3NKEY/scroll-lock) - DOM scroll lock\n - [body-scroll-lock](https://github.com/willmcpo/body-scroll-lock) - DOM scroll lock\n \n > This package is relative smaller(1), more react friendly(2), works with non zero body margins(3), and has a better \"overscroll\" management. \n\n# License\nMIT"

Differences include iterating\nover the string *backwards* (as that is faster in JavaScript) and using the XOR\noperator instead of the addition operator (as described at that page and\nbecause it obviates the need for modular arithmetic in JavaScript).\n\nThe hashing function returns a number between 0 and 4294967295 (inclusive).\n\nThanks to [cscott](https://github.com/cscott) for reminding us how integers\nwork in JavaScript.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nTo the extend possible by law, The Dark Sky Company, LLC has [waived all\ncopyright and related or neighboring rights][cc0] to this library.\n\n[cc0]: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"

If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*\n\nThis package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.\n\n```js\nimport {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp';\nimport * as ts from 'typescript';\n\nfunction createCompilerHost(\n  compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions,\n): ts.CompilerHost {\n  const compilerHost = {\n    resolveModuleNames,\n    resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,\n  };\n\n  return compilerHost;\n\n  function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;\n    });\n  }\n\n  function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For, actually, fork\n- `transformRef` - transform one ref to anther\n- `refToCallback` - convert RefObject to an old callback-style ref\n- `assignRef` - assign value to the ref, regardless of it's form\n\nAll functions are tree shakable, but even together it's __less then 300b__.\n\n# API\n💡 Some commands are hooks based, and returns the same refs/functions every render. \nBut some are not, to be used in classes or non-react code.\n\n## useRef API\n🤔 Use case: every time you have to react to ref change\n\nAPI is 99% compatible with React `createRef` and `useRef`, and just adds another argument - `callback`,\nwhich would be called on __ref update__.\n\n#### createCallbackRef - to replace React.createRef\n- `createCallbackRef(callback)` -  would call provided `callback` when ref is changed.\n\n#### useCallbackRef - to replace React.useRef\n- `useCallbackRef(initialValue, callback)` - would call provided `callback` when ref is changed.\n\n> `callback` in both cases is `callback(newValue, oldValue)`. Callback would not be called if newValue and oldValue is the same.\n\n```js\nimport {useRef, createRef, useState} from 'react';\nimport {useCallbackRef, createCallbackRef} from 'use-callback-ref';\n\nconst Component = () => {\n  const [,forceUpdate] = useState();\n  // I dont need callback when ref changes\n  const ref = useRef(null); \n  \n  // but sometimes - it could be what you need\n  const anotherRef = useCallbackRef(null, () => forceUpdate());\n  \n  useEffect( () => {\n    // now it's just possible\n  }, [anotherRef.current]) // react to dom node change\n}\n```\n\n💡 You can use `useCallbackRef` to convert RefObject into RefCallback, creating bridges between the old and the new code\n```js\n// some old component\nconst onRefUpdate = (newValue) => {...}\nconst refObject = useCallbackRef(null, onRefUpdate);\n// ...\n<SomeNewComponent ref={refObject}/>\n```\n\n## assignRef\n🤔 Use case: every time you need to assign ref manually, and you dont know the shape of the ref\n\n`assignRef(ref, value)` - assigns `values` to the `ref`. `ref` could be RefObject or RefCallback.\n\n```\n🚫 ref.current = value // what if it's a callback-ref?\n🚫 ref(value) // but what if it's a object ref?\n\nimport {assignRef} from \"use-callback-ref\";\n✅ assignRef(ref, value); \n```\n\n## useTransformRef (to replace React.useImperativeHandle)\n🤔 Use case: ref could be different. \n`transformRef(ref, tranformer):Ref` - return a new `ref` which would propagate all changes to the provided `ref` with applied `transform`\n\n```js\n// before\nconst ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =>\n  <Resizable {...props} ref={i => i && ref(i.resizable)}/>\n);\n\n// after\n\nconst ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =>\n  <Resizable {...props} ref={transformRef(ref, i => i ? i.resizable : null)}/>\n);\n```\n\n## refToCallback\n`refToCallback(ref: RefObject): RefCallback` - for compatibility between the old and the new code.\nFor the compatibility between `RefCallback` and RefObject use `useCallbackRef(undefined, callback)` \n\n## useMergeRefs\n`mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef` - merges a few refs together\n\nWhen developing low level UI components, it is common to have to use a local ref but also support an external one using React.forwardRef. Natively, React does not offer a way to set two refs inside the ref property. This is the goal of this small utility.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useMergeRefs} from 'use-callback-ref'\n\nconst MergedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  const localRef = React.useRef();\n  // ...\n  // both localRef and ref would be populated with the `ref` to a `div`\n  return <div ref={useMergeRefs([localRef, ref])} />\n})\n```\n\n💡 - `useMergeRefs` will always give you the same return, and you don't have to worry about `[localRef, ref]` unique every render.\n\n## mergeRefs \n`mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef` - merges a few refs together\nis a non-hook based version. Will produce the new `ref` every run, causing the old one to unmount, and be _populated_ with the `null` value.\n\n> mergeRefs are based on https://github.com/smooth-code/react-merge-refs, just exposes a RefObject, instead of a callback\n\n`mergeRefs` are \"safe\" to use as a part of other hooks-based commands, but don't forget - it returns a new object every call. \n\n# Similar packages:\n- [apply-ref](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton/apply-ref) - `applyRefs` is simular to `mergeRef`, `applyRef` is similar to `assignRef`\n- [useForkRef](https://react-hooks.org/docs/use-fork-ref) - `useForkRef` is simular to `useMergeRefs`, but accepts only two arguments.\n- [react-merge-refs](https://github.com/gregberge/react-merge-refs) - `merge-refs` is simular to `useMergeRefs`, but not a hook and does not provide \"stable\" reference.\n\n---\n\n> Is it a rocket science? No, `RefObject` is no more than `{current: ref}`, and `use-callback-ref` is no more than `getter` and `setter` on that field.\n\n# License\nMIT"

Like Batman(UI) and his sidekick Robin(effects). \n\n## Concept\n- a `package` exposes __3 entry points__ using a [nested `package.json` format](https://github.com/theKashey/multiple-entry-points-example):\n  - default aka `combination`, and lets hope tree shaking will save you\n  - `UI`, with only UI part\n  - `sidecar`, with all the logic\n  - > `UI` + `sidecar` === `combination`. The size of `UI+sidecar` might a bit bigger than size of their `combination`.\n  Use [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) to control their size independently. \n  \n\n- package uses a `medium` to talk with own sidecar, breaking explicit dependency.\n \n- if package depends on another _sidecar_ package:\n  - it shall export dependency side car among own sidecar.\n  - package imports own sidecar via `medium`, thus able to export multiple sidecars via one export. \n\n- final consumer uses `sidecar` or `useSidecar` to combine pieces together.  \n\n## Rules\n- `UI` components might use/import any other `UI` components\n- `sidecar` could use/import any other `sidecar`\n\nThat would form two different code branches, you may load separately - UI first, and effect sidecar later.\nThat also leads to a obvious consequence - __one sidecar may export all sidecars__.\n- to decouple `sidecars` from module exports, and be able to pick \"the right\" one at any point\nyou have to use `exportSidecar(medium, component)` to export it, and use the same `medium` to import it back.\n- this limitation is for __libraries only__, as long as in the usercode you might \ndynamically import whatever and whenever you want. \n\n- `useMedium` is always async - action would be executed in a next tick, or on the logic load.\n- `sidecar` is always async - is does not matter have you loaded logic or not - component would be \nrendered at least in the next tick.\n\n> except `medium.read`, which synchronously read the data from a medium, \nand `medium.assingSyncMedium` which changes `useMedium` to be sync. \n\n## SSR and usage tracking\nSidecar pattern is clear:\n- you dont need to use/render any `sidecars` on server.\n- you dont have to load `sidecars` prior main render.\n\nThus - no usage tracking, and literally no SSR. It's just skipped.\n\n\n# API\n\n## createMedium()\n- Type: Util. Creates shared effect medium for algebraic effect.\n- Goal: To decouple modules from each other.\n- Usage: `use` in UI side, and `assign` from side-car. All effects would be executed.\n- Analog: WeakMap, React.__SECRET_DOM_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED\n```js\nconst medium = createMedium(defaultValue);\nconst cancelCb = medium.useMedium(someData);\n\n// like\nuseEffect(() => medium.useMedium(someData), []);\n\nmedium.assignMedium(someDataProcessor)\n\n// createSidecarMedium is a helper for createMedium to create a \"sidecar\" symbol\nconst effectCar = createSidecarMedium();\n```\n\n> ! For consistence `useMedium` is async - sidecar load status should not affect function behavior,\nthus effect would be always executed at least in the \"next tick\". You may alter\nthis behavior by using `medium.assingSyncMedium`.\n\n\n## exportSidecar(medium, component)\n- Type: HOC\n- Goal: store `component` inside `medium` and return external wrapper\n- Solving: decoupling module exports to support exporting multiple sidecars via a single entry point.\n- Usage: use to export a `sidecar`\n- Analog: WeakMap\n```js\nimport {effectCar} from './medium';\nimport {EffectComponent} from './Effect';\n// !!! - to prevent Effect from being imported\n// `effectCar` medium __have__ to be defined in another file\n// const effectCar = createSidecarMedium();\nexport default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);\n```\n\n## sidecar(importer)\n- Type: HOC\n- Goal: React.lazy analog for code splitting, but does not require `Suspense`, might provide error failback.\n- Usage: like React.lazy to load a side-car component.\n- Analog: React.Lazy\n```js\nimport {sidecar} from \"use-sidecar\";\nconst Sidecar =  sidecar(() => import('./sidecar'), <span>on fail</span>);\n\n<>\n <Sidecar />\n <UI />\n</> \n```\n### Importing `exportedSidecar`\nWould require additional prop to be set - ```<Sidecar sideCar={effectCar} />```\n\n## useSidecar(importer)\n- Type: hook, loads a `sideCar` using provided `importer` which shall follow React.lazy API\n- Goal: to load a side car without displaying any \"spinners\".\n- Usage: load side car for a component\n- Analog: none\n```js\nimport {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';\n\nconst [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'));\nreturn (\n  <>\n    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}\n    <UIComponent {...props}>\n  </>\n); \n```\n### Importing `exportedSideCar`\nYou have to specify __effect medium__ to read data from, as long as __export itself is empty__.\n```js\nimport {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';\n\n/* medium.js: */ export const effectCar = useMedium({});\n/* sideCar.js: */export default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);\n\nconst [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'), effectCar); \nreturn (\n  <>\n    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}\n    <UIComponent {...props}>\n  </>\n);\n```\n\n## renderCar(Component)\n- Type: HOC, moves renderProp component to a side channel\n- Goal: Provide render prop support, ie defer component loading keeping tree untouched.\n- Usage: Provide `defaults` and use them until sidecar is loaded letting you code split (non visual) render-prop component\n- Analog: - Analog: code split library like [react-imported-library](https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-library) or [@loadable/lib](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/library-splitting/).\n```js\nimport {renderCar, sidecar} from \"use-sidecar\";\nconst RenderCar = renderCar(\n  // will move side car to a side channel\n  sidecar(() => import('react-powerplug').then(imports => imports.Value)),\n  // default render props\n  [{value: 0}]  \n);\n\n<RenderCar>\n  {({value}) => <span>{value}</span>}\n</RenderCar>\n```\n\n## setConfig(config)\n```js\nsetConfig({\n  onError, // sets default error handler\n});\n```\n\n# Examples\n## Deferred effect\nLet's imagine - on element focus you have to do \"something\", for example focus anther element\n\n#### Original code\n```js\nonFocus = event => {\n  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {\n    document.querySelectorAll('button', event.currentTarget)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Sidecar code\n\n3. Use medium (yes, .3)\n```js\n// we are calling medium with an original event as an argument\nconst onFocus = event => focusMedium.useMedium(event);\n```\n2. Define reaction\n```js\n// in a sidecar\n\n// we are setting handler for the effect medium\n// effect is complicated - we are skipping event \"bubbling\", \n// and focusing some button inside a parent\nfocusMedium.assignMedium(event => {\n  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {\n    document.querySelectorAll('button', event.currentTarget)\n  }\n});\n\n```\n1. Create medium\nHaving these constrains - we have to clone `event`, as long as React would eventually reuse SyntheticEvent, thus not\npreserve `target` and `currentTarget`. \n```js\n// \nconst focusMedium = createMedium(null, event => ({...event}));\n```\nNow medium side effect is ok to be async\n\n__Example__: [Effect for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/Lock.js#L48) - 1kb UI, 4kb sidecar\n\n### Medium callback\nLike a library level code splitting\n\n#### Original code\n```js\nimport {x, y} from './utils';\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (x()) {\n    y()\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n#### Sidecar code\n\n```js\n// medium\nconst utilMedium = createMedium();\n\n// utils\nconst x = () => { /* ... */};\nconst y = () => { /* ... */};\n\n// medium will callback with exports exposed\nutilMedium.assignMedium(cb => cb({\n x, y\n}));\n\n\n// UI\n// not importing x and y from the module system, but would be given via callback\nuseEffect(() => {\n  utilMedium.useMedium(({x,y}) => {\n      if (x()) {\n        y()\n      }\n  })\n}, []);\n```\n\n- Hint: there is a easy way to type it\n```js\nconst utilMedium = createMedium<(cb: typeof import('./utils')) => void>();\n``` \n\n__Example__: [Callback API for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/MoveFocusInside.js#L12) \n\n### Split effects\nLets take an example from a Google - Calendar app, with view and logic separated.\nTo be honest - it's not easy to extract logic from application like calendar - usually it's tight coupled.\n\n#### Original code\n```js\nconst CalendarUI = () => { \n  const [date, setDate] = useState();\n  const onButtonClick = useCallback(() => setDate(Date.now), []);\n  \n  return (\n    <>\n     <input type=\"date\" onChange={setDate} value={date} />\n     <input type=\"button\" onClick={onButtonClick}>Set Today</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n#### Sidecar code\n\n```js\nconst CalendarUI = () => {\n  const [events, setEvents] = useState({});\n  const [date, setDate] = useState();\n  \n  return (\n    <>\n     <Sidecar setDate={setDate} setEvents={setEvents}/>\n     <UILayout {...events} date={date}/>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nconst UILayout = ({onDateChange, onButtonClick, date}) => (\n  <>\n      <input type=\"date\" onChange={onDateChange} value={date} />\n      <input type=\"button\" onClick={onButtonClick}>Set Today</button>\n  </>\n);\n\n// in a sidecar\n// we are providing callbacks back to UI\nconst Sidecar = ({setDate, setEvents}) => {\n  useEffect(() => setEvents({\n      onDateChange:setDate,\n      onButtonClick: () => setDate(Date.now),\n  }), []);\n  \n  return null;\n}\n```  \n\nWhile in this example this looks a bit, you know, strange - there are 3 times more code\nthat in the original example - that would make a sense for a real Calendar, especially\nif some helper library, like `moment`, has been used.\n\n__Example__: [Effect for react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll/blob/666472d5c77fb6c4e5beffdde87c53ae63ef42c5/src/SideEffect.tsx#L166) - 300b UI, 2kb sidecar\n\n# Licence\n\nMIT"
