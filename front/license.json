You'll get access to the internal state\n`isOpen` and method `onClose`.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  {({ isOpen }) => (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      <MenuButton>{isOpen ? \"Close\" : \"Open\"}</MenuButton>\n      <MenuList>\n        <MenuItem>Download</MenuItem>\n        <MenuItem onClick={() => alert(\"Kagebunshin\")}>Create a Copy</MenuItem>\n      </MenuList>\n    </React.Fragment>\n  )}\n</Menu>\n```\n\n### Letter Navigation\n\nWhen focus is on the `MenuButton` or within the `MenuList` and you type a letter\nkey, a search begins. Focus will move to the first `MenuItem` that starts with\nthe letter you typed.\n\n> Open the menu, try and type any letter, say \"S\" to see the focus movement.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <MenuButton\n    px={4}\n    py={2}\n    transition=\"all 0.2s\"\n    borderRadius=\"md\"\n    borderWidth=\"1px\"\n    _hover={{ bg: \"gray.100\" }}\n    _expanded={{ bg: \"red.200\" }}\n    _focus={{ outline: 0, boxShadow: \"outline\" }}\n  >\n    File <ChevronDownIcon />\n  </MenuButton>\n  <MenuList>\n    <MenuItem>New File</MenuItem>\n    <MenuItem>New Window</MenuItem>\n    <MenuDivider />\n    <MenuItem>Open...</MenuItem>\n    <MenuItem>Save File</MenuItem>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n### Just another example.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <MenuButton>Your Cats</MenuButton>\n  <MenuList>\n    <MenuItem minH=\"48px\">\n      <Image\n        size=\"2rem\"\n        borderRadius=\"full\"\n        src=\"https://placekitten.com/100/100\"\n        alt=\"Fluffybuns the destroyer\"\n        mr=\"12px\"\n      />\n      <span>Fluffybuns the Destroyer</span>\n    </MenuItem>\n    <MenuItem minH=\"40px\">\n      <Image\n        size=\"2rem\"\n        borderRadius=\"full\"\n        src=\"https://placekitten.com/120/120\"\n        alt=\"Simon the pensive\"\n        mr=\"12px\"\n      />\n      <span>Simon the pensive</span>\n    </MenuItem>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n### MenuGroup\n\nTo group related `MenuItems`, use the `MenuGroup` component and pass it a label\nfor the group name.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu>\n  <MenuButton>Profile</MenuButton>\n  <MenuList>\n    <MenuGroup title=\"Profile\">\n      <MenuItem>My Account</MenuItem>\n      <MenuItem>Payments </MenuItem>\n    </MenuGroup>\n    <MenuDivider />\n    <MenuGroup title=\"Help\">\n      <MenuItem>Docs</MenuItem>\n      <MenuItem>FAQ</MenuItem>\n    </MenuGroup>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n## Menu option groups\n\nYou can compose a menu for table headers to help with sorting and filtering\noptions. Use the `MenuOptionGroup` and `MenuItemOption` components.\n\n```jsx\n<Menu closeOnSelect={false}>\n  <MenuButton>MenuItem</MenuButton>\n  <MenuList minWidth=\"240px\">\n    <MenuOptionGroup defaultValue=\"asc\" title=\"Order\" type=\"radio\">\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"asc\">Ascending</MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"desc\">Descending</MenuItemOption>\n    </MenuOptionGroup>\n    <MenuDivider />\n    <MenuOptionGroup title=\"Country\" type=\"checkbox\">\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"email\">Email</MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"phone\">Phone</MenuItemOption>\n      <MenuItemOption value=\"country\">Country</MenuItemOption>\n    </MenuOptionGroup>\n  </MenuList>\n</Menu>\n```"

Take for example\nan image upload operation:\n\n- Before upload begins, the upload progress is indeterminate (at this point,\n  it’s just spinning),\n- Once we know the size of the image and begin upload (using axios) then we\n  update the progress value of the CircularProgress (at this point, it shows the\n  progress). CircularProgress also comes with the aria-\\* attributes to make its\n  progress value accessible to screenreaders.\n\nCircularProgress also comes with the aria-\\* attributes to make its progress\nvalue accessible to screenreaders.\n\n### Spinner\n\nIt is more of a “presentational” loading indicator you can use on a page or a\ncomponent, while it’s loading or before it renders. It doesn’t have any semantic\nmeaning.\n\nTo give meaning to a Spinner/loading indicator, ARIA standards require that you\nmark the area of the component/page that’s loading with `aria-busy=true`."

Chakra UI contains a set of polished React components\n  that work out of the box.\n\n- Flexible & composable. Chakra UI components are built on top of a React UI\n  Primitive for endless composability.\n\n- Accessible. Chakra UI components follows the WAI-ARIA guidelines\n  specifications.\n\n- Dark Mode 😍: All components are dark mode compatible.\n\n## Looking for the documentation?\n\nhttps://chakra-ui.com\n\n## Installing Chakra UI\n\n⚡️Chakra UI is made up of multiple components and tools which you can import\none by one. All you need to do is install the `@chakra-ui/react` package:\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add @chakra-ui/react\n# or\n$ npm install --save @chakra-ui/react\n```\n\n# Getting set up\n\nTo start using the components, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Wrap your application in a `ThemeProvider` provided by **@chakra-ui/react**\n\n```jsx\nimport { ThemeProvider, ColorModeProvider } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\nconst App = ({ children }) => (\n  <ThemeProvider>\n    <ColorModeProvider>{children}</ColorModeProvider>\n  </ThemeProvider>\n)\n```\n\n`ColorModeProvider` is a context that provides light mode and dark mode values\nto the components. It also comes with a function to toggle between light/dark\nmode.\n\n2. Now you can start using components like so!:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\nconst App = () => <Button>I just consumed some ⚡️Chakra!</Button>\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nFeel like contributing? That's awesome! We have a\n[contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to help guide you.\n\nThe components to be built come from the\n[Aria Practices Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1).\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people\n([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/segunadebayo\"><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6916170?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Segun Adebayo\"/><br /><sub><b>Segun Adebayo</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=segunadebayo\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"#maintenance-segunadebayo\" title=\"Maintenance\">🚧</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=segunadebayo\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#example-segunadebayo\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#design-segunadebayo\" title=\"Design\">🎨</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/tioluwani94\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11310046?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"Tioluwani Kolawole\"/><br /><sub><b>Tioluwani Kolawole</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commits?author=tioluwani94\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#example-tioluwani94\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#maintenance-tioluwani94\" title=\"Maintenance\">🚧</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the\n[all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors)\nspecification.

Users can create\nany component using the `chakra.[element]`. The resulting component will be a\nstyled component and have all system props.\n\n```jsx\n<chakra.button bg=\"green.200\" _hover={{ bg: \"green.300\" }}>\n  Click me\n</chakra.button>\n\n<chakra.h1 fontSize=\"lg\"> Heading </chakra.h1>\n\n// create your own box\nconst Box = chakra.div\n\n// you can still use the `as` prop\n<Box as=\"h1\">This is my box</Box>\n\n// for custom components\nconst ChakraPowered = chakra(YourComponent)\n\n// TS: chakra will infer the types of Link and\n// make it available in props\n<chakra.a as={Link} to=\"/home\"> Click me</chakra.a>\n```\n\n### Chakra Component API\n\nA way to define themable components in chakra. We believe most re-usable, atomic\ncomponents have the following modifiers:\n\n- Size: It has different size variations (small, medium, large)\n- Variant: It has different visual style (outline, solid, ghost)\n- Color scheme (Optional): For a given variant, it can have several color\n  scheme. For example, an outline button with a red color scheme.\n- Color mode (Optional): Components also change their visual styles based on the\n  user preferred color mode (light or dark)\n\nOur goal with this component API to design a common interface to style any\ncomponent give these characteristics. Here's how it works:\n\n```jsx\n// 1. create a component schema in your theme\nconst theme = {\n\tcolors: {\n    green: {\n      light: \"#dfdfdf\",\n      normal: \"#dfdfdf\",\n      dark: \"#d566Df\",\n      darker: \"#dfd56f\"\n    },\n\t\tblue: {}\n  },\n  components: {\n    Button: {\n      defaultProps: {\n        variant: \"solid\",\n        size: \"md\",\n\t\t\t\tcolorScheme: \"blue\"\n      },\n      variants: {\n\t\t\t\t// props has colorScheme, colorMode (light mode or dark mode)\n        solid: props => ({\n          bg: `${props.colorScheme}.normal`,\n          color: \"white\",\n        }),\n        outline: {\n          border: \"2px\",\n          borderColor: \"green.normal\"\n        }\n      },\n      sizes: {\n        sm: {\n          padding: 20,\n          fontSize: 12\n        },\n        md: {\n          padding: 40,\n          fontSize: 15\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n// 2. create or import Button from chakra-ui\nimport { Button } from \"@chakra-ui/react\"\n\n// or your own button\nconst Button = chakra(\"button\", { themeKey: \"Button\" })\n\n// 3. use the button. It'll have the visual props defined in defaultProps\n<Button>Click me</Button>\n\n// 4. override the defaultProps\n<Button variant=\"outline\" colorScheme=\"green\">Click me</Button>\n```"

Each variant comes it\ndifferent color schemes.\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs variant=\"enclosed\" colorScheme=\"red\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```\n\n### Manually Activated Tabs\n\nBy default, `Tabs` are activated automatically. This means when you use the\narrow keys to change tabs, the tab is activated and focused.\n\nThe content of a `TabPanel` should ideally be preloaded. However, if switching\nto a tab panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, there might\nbe some notable latency and this might affect the experience for keyboard and\nscreen reader users.\n\nIn this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, it moves focus\nwithout activating the tabs. With focus on a specifc tab, users can activate a\ntab by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs isManual variant=\"enclosed\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```\n\n### Tab sizes\n\nYou can change the size of the tab by passing `size` prop. We support 3 sizes\n`sm`, `md`, `lg`\n\n```jsx\n<Tabs size=\"md\" variant=\"enclosed\">\n  <TabList>\n    <Tab>One</Tab>\n    <Tab>Two</Tab>\n  </TabList>\n  <TabPanels>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>one!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n    <TabPanel>\n      <p>two!</p>\n    </TabPanel>\n  </TabPanels>\n</Tabs>\n```"

Our licenses are\n     irrevocable.

More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Most of\nthe curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective\nor extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.\n\nAll operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is\nprovided by [hash.js][2]\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both\n  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for\n  node)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2014.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License."

Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.\n\nIn case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [{\n      test: /\\.js$/,\n      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n    }]\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By default it might be prevented. However - pinch and zoom might break \"scroll isolation\", and __disabled by default__.\n- `[noIsolation=false]` - disables outer event capturing. Event capturing is React friendly and unlikely be a problem.\nBut if you are using _shadowbox_ of some sort - you dont need it.\n- `[inert=false]` - ☠️(be careful) disables events the rest of page completely using `pointer-events` except the Lock(+shards). \nReact portals not friendly, might lead to production issues. Enable only for __rare__ cases, when you have to disable scrollbars somewhere on the page(except body, Lock and shards).  \n- `[forwardProps]` - will forward all props to the `children`\n- `[className]` - className for an internal div\n- `[removeScrollBar]` - to control scroll bar removal. Set to false, if you prefer to keep it (wheel and touch scroll is still disabled).\n\n# Size\n- (🧩 full) 1.7kb after compression (excluding tslib).\n---\n- (👁 UI) __400b__, visual elements only\n- (🚗 sidecar) 1.5kb, side effects\n```js\nimport {sidecar} from \"react-remove-scroll\";\nimport {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll/UI';\n\nconst sidecar = sidecar(() => import('react-remove-scroll/sidecar'));\n\n<RemoveScroll sideCar={sidecar}>\n  Will load logic from a sidecar when needed\n</RemoveScroll>  \n```\n\n> Consider setting `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` on a document level for a proper mobile experience.\n\n## Internal div\nBut default RemoveScroll will create a div to handle and capture events.\nYou may specify `className` for it, if you need, or __remove it__.\n\nThe following code samples will produce the same output\n```js\n<RemoveScroll className=\"scroll\">\n  Only this content would be scrollable\n</RemoveScroll>\n```\n\n```js\n<RemoveScroll forwardProps>\n  <div className=\"scroll\"> //RemoveScroll will inject props to this div\n    Only this content would be scrollable\n  </div>\n</RemoveScroll> \n```\nPick the first one if you don't need a second.\n\n## Position:fixed elements\nTo properly size these elements please add a special className to them.\n```jsx\nimport {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll';\n\n// to make \"width: 100%\"\n<div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.fullWidth)} />\n\n// to make \"right:0\"\n<div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.zeroRight)} />\n```\nSee [react-remove-scroll-bar](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll-bar) documentation for details.\n\n## More than one lock\nWhen stacked more is active (default) only one (last) component would be active.\n\n## Over isolation\nThat could happen - \nyou disable scroll on the body, \nyou are suppressing all scroll and wheel events,\nand you are ghosting the rest of the page by the `inert` prop.\n\nOnly something inside Lock does exists for the browser, and that might be less than you expected.\n\nDont forget about `shard`, dont forget - `inert` is not portals friendly, dont forget - you dont need over isolation in most of the cases.\n\n> just be careful! \n\n# Performance\nTo do the job this library setup _non_ passive event listener. Chrome dev tools would complain about it, as a \nperformance no-op.\n\nWe have to use synchronous scroll/touch handler, and it may affect scrolling performance.\n\nConsider using `noIsolation` mode, if you have large scrollable areas.\n\n# Supported React versions\n- v1 supports React 15/16\n- v2 requires 16.8.0+ (hooks)\n\n# Scroll-Locky\nThis is a refactoring of another library - [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky) -\nto make package smaller and more react-portals friendly.\n\n## See also\n - [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) - Finite Modal creator (uses Scroll-Locky) underneath.\n - [react-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-locky) - React event canceler\n - [react-scrolllock](https://github.com/jossmac/react-scrolllock) - React scroll lock\n - [scroll-lock](https://github.com/FL3NKEY/scroll-lock) - DOM scroll lock\n - [body-scroll-lock](https://github.com/willmcpo/body-scroll-lock) - DOM scroll lock\n \n > This package is relative smaller(1), more react friendly(2), works with non zero body margins(3), and has a better \"overscroll\" management. \n\n# License\nMIT"

The particular algorithm is quite\nsimilar to `djb2`, by Dan Bernstein and available\n[here](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html). Differences include iterating\nover the string *backwards* (as that is faster in JavaScript) and using the XOR\noperator instead of the addition operator (as described at that page and\nbecause it obviates the need for modular arithmetic in JavaScript).\n\nThe hashing function returns a number between 0 and 4294967295 (inclusive).\n\nThanks to [cscott](https://github.com/cscott) for reminding us how integers\nwork in JavaScript.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nTo the extend possible by law, The Dark Sky Company, LLC has [waived all\ncopyright and related or neighboring rights][cc0] to this library.\n\n[cc0]: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"

If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*\n\nThis package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.\n\n```js\nimport {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp';\nimport * as ts from 'typescript';\n\nfunction createCompilerHost(\n  compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions,\n): ts.CompilerHost {\n  const compilerHost = {\n    resolveModuleNames,\n    resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,\n  };\n\n  return compilerHost;\n\n  function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;\n    });\n  }\n\n  function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For, actually, fork\n- `transformRef` - transform one ref to anther\n- `refToCallback` - convert RefObject to an old callback-style ref\n- `assignRef` - assign value to the ref, regardless of it's form\n\nAll functions are tree shakable, but even together it's __less then 300b__.\n\n# API\n💡 Some commands are hooks based, and returns the same refs/functions every render. \nBut some are not, to be used in classes or non-react code.\n\n## useRef API\n🤔 Use case: every time you have to react to ref change\n\nAPI is 99% compatible with React `createRef` and `useRef`, and just adds another argument - `callback`,\nwhich would be called on __ref update__.\n\n#### createCallbackRef - to replace React.createRef\n- `createCallbackRef(callback)` -  would call provided `callback` when ref is changed.\n\n#### useCallbackRef - to replace React.useRef\n- `useCallbackRef(initialValue, callback)` - would call provided `callback` when ref is changed.\n\n> `callback` in both cases is `callback(newValue, oldValue)`. Callback would not be called if newValue and oldValue is the same.\n\n```js\nimport {useRef, createRef, useState} from 'react';\nimport {useCallbackRef, createCallbackRef} from 'use-callback-ref';\n\nconst Component = () => {\n  const [,forceUpdate] = useState();\n  // I dont need callback when ref changes\n  const ref = useRef(null); \n  \n  // but sometimes - it could be what you need\n  const anotherRef = useCallbackRef(null, () => forceUpdate());\n  \n  useEffect( () => {\n    // now it's just possible\n  }, [anotherRef.current]) // react to dom node change\n}\n```\n\n💡 You can use `useCallbackRef` to convert RefObject into RefCallback, creating bridges between the old and the new code\n```js\n// some old component\nconst onRefUpdate = (newValue) => {...}\nconst refObject = useCallbackRef(null, onRefUpdate);\n// ...\n<SomeNewComponent ref={refObject}/>\n```\n\n## assignRef\n🤔 Use case: every time you need to assign ref manually, and you dont know the shape of the ref\n\n`assignRef(ref, value)` - assigns `values` to the `ref`. `ref` could be RefObject or RefCallback.\n\n```\n🚫 ref.current = value // what if it's a callback-ref?\n🚫 ref(value) // but what if it's a object ref?\n\nimport {assignRef} from \"use-callback-ref\";\n✅ assignRef(ref, value); \n```\n\n## useTransformRef (to replace React.useImperativeHandle)\n🤔 Use case: ref could be different. \n`transformRef(ref, tranformer):Ref` - return a new `ref` which would propagate all changes to the provided `ref` with applied `transform`\n\n```js\n// before\nconst ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =>\n  <Resizable {...props} ref={i => i && ref(i.resizable)}/>\n);\n\n// after\n\nconst ResizableWithRef = forwardRef((props, ref) =>\n  <Resizable {...props} ref={transformRef(ref, i => i ? i.resizable : null)}/>\n);\n```\n\n## refToCallback\n`refToCallback(ref: RefObject): RefCallback` - for compatibility between the old and the new code.\nFor the compatibility between `RefCallback` and RefObject use `useCallbackRef(undefined, callback)` \n\n## useMergeRefs\n`mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef` - merges a few refs together\n\nWhen developing low level UI components, it is common to have to use a local ref but also support an external one using React.forwardRef. Natively, React does not offer a way to set two refs inside the ref property. This is the goal of this small utility.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useMergeRefs} from 'use-callback-ref'\n\nconst MergedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  const localRef = React.useRef();\n  // ...\n  // both localRef and ref would be populated with the `ref` to a `div`\n  return <div ref={useMergeRefs([localRef, ref])} />\n})\n```\n\n💡 - `useMergeRefs` will always give you the same return, and you don't have to worry about `[localRef, ref]` unique every render.\n\n## mergeRefs \n`mergeRefs(refs: arrayOfRefs, [defaultValue]):ReactMutableRef` - merges a few refs together\nis a non-hook based version. Will produce the new `ref` every run, causing the old one to unmount, and be _populated_ with the `null` value.\n\n> mergeRefs are based on https://github.com/smooth-code/react-merge-refs, just exposes a RefObject, instead of a callback\n\n`mergeRefs` are \"safe\" to use as a part of other hooks-based commands, but don't forget - it returns a new object every call. \n\n# Similar packages:\n- [apply-ref](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton/apply-ref) - `applyRefs` is simular to `mergeRef`, `applyRef` is similar to `assignRef`\n- [useForkRef](https://react-hooks.org/docs/use-fork-ref) - `useForkRef` is simular to `useMergeRefs`, but accepts only two arguments.\n- [react-merge-refs](https://github.com/gregberge/react-merge-refs) - `merge-refs` is simular to `useMergeRefs`, but not a hook and does not provide \"stable\" reference.\n\n---\n\n> Is it a rocket science? No, `RefObject` is no more than `{current: ref}`, and `use-callback-ref` is no more than `getter` and `setter` on that field.\n\n# License\nMIT"

Like Batman(UI) and his sidekick Robin(effects). \n\n## Concept\n- a `package` exposes __3 entry points__ using a [nested `package.json` format](https://github.com/theKashey/multiple-entry-points-example):\n  - default aka `combination`, and lets hope tree shaking will save you\n  - `UI`, with only UI part\n  - `sidecar`, with all the logic\n  - > `UI` + `sidecar` === `combination`. The size of `UI+sidecar` might a bit bigger than size of their `combination`.\n  Use [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) to control their size independently. \n  \n\n- package uses a `medium` to talk with own sidecar, breaking explicit dependency.\n \n- if package depends on another _sidecar_ package:\n  - it shall export dependency side car among own sidecar.\n  - package imports own sidecar via `medium`, thus able to export multiple sidecars via one export. \n\n- final consumer uses `sidecar` or `useSidecar` to combine pieces together.  \n\n## Rules\n- `UI` components might use/import any other `UI` components\n- `sidecar` could use/import any other `sidecar`\n\nThat would form two different code branches, you may load separately - UI first, and effect sidecar later.\nThat also leads to a obvious consequence - __one sidecar may export all sidecars__.\n- to decouple `sidecars` from module exports, and be able to pick \"the right\" one at any point\nyou have to use `exportSidecar(medium, component)` to export it, and use the same `medium` to import it back.\n- this limitation is for __libraries only__, as long as in the usercode you might \ndynamically import whatever and whenever you want. \n\n- `useMedium` is always async - action would be executed in a next tick, or on the logic load.\n- `sidecar` is always async - is does not matter have you loaded logic or not - component would be \nrendered at least in the next tick.\n\n> except `medium.read`, which synchronously read the data from a medium, \nand `medium.assingSyncMedium` which changes `useMedium` to be sync. \n\n## SSR and usage tracking\nSidecar pattern is clear:\n- you dont need to use/render any `sidecars` on server.\n- you dont have to load `sidecars` prior main render.\n\nThus - no usage tracking, and literally no SSR. It's just skipped.\n\n\n# API\n\n## createMedium()\n- Type: Util. Creates shared effect medium for algebraic effect.\n- Goal: To decouple modules from each other.\n- Usage: `use` in UI side, and `assign` from side-car. All effects would be executed.\n- Analog: WeakMap, React.__SECRET_DOM_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED\n```js\nconst medium = createMedium(defaultValue);\nconst cancelCb = medium.useMedium(someData);\n\n// like\nuseEffect(() => medium.useMedium(someData), []);\n\nmedium.assignMedium(someDataProcessor)\n\n// createSidecarMedium is a helper for createMedium to create a \"sidecar\" symbol\nconst effectCar = createSidecarMedium();\n```\n\n> ! For consistence `useMedium` is async - sidecar load status should not affect function behavior,\nthus effect would be always executed at least in the \"next tick\". You may alter\nthis behavior by using `medium.assingSyncMedium`.\n\n\n## exportSidecar(medium, component)\n- Type: HOC\n- Goal: store `component` inside `medium` and return external wrapper\n- Solving: decoupling module exports to support exporting multiple sidecars via a single entry point.\n- Usage: use to export a `sidecar`\n- Analog: WeakMap\n```js\nimport {effectCar} from './medium';\nimport {EffectComponent} from './Effect';\n// !!! - to prevent Effect from being imported\n// `effectCar` medium __have__ to be defined in another file\n// const effectCar = createSidecarMedium();\nexport default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);\n```\n\n## sidecar(importer)\n- Type: HOC\n- Goal: React.lazy analog for code splitting, but does not require `Suspense`, might provide error failback.\n- Usage: like React.lazy to load a side-car component.\n- Analog: React.Lazy\n```js\nimport {sidecar} from \"use-sidecar\";\nconst Sidecar =  sidecar(() => import('./sidecar'), <span>on fail</span>);\n\n<>\n <Sidecar />\n <UI />\n</> \n```\n### Importing `exportedSidecar`\nWould require additional prop to be set - ```<Sidecar sideCar={effectCar} />```\n\n## useSidecar(importer)\n- Type: hook, loads a `sideCar` using provided `importer` which shall follow React.lazy API\n- Goal: to load a side car without displaying any \"spinners\".\n- Usage: load side car for a component\n- Analog: none\n```js\nimport {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';\n\nconst [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'));\nreturn (\n  <>\n    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}\n    <UIComponent {...props}>\n  </>\n); \n```\n### Importing `exportedSideCar`\nYou have to specify __effect medium__ to read data from, as long as __export itself is empty__.\n```js\nimport {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';\n\n/* medium.js: */ export const effectCar = useMedium({});\n/* sideCar.js: */export default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);\n\nconst [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'), effectCar); \nreturn (\n  <>\n    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}\n    <UIComponent {...props}>\n  </>\n);\n```\n\n## renderCar(Component)\n- Type: HOC, moves renderProp component to a side channel\n- Goal: Provide render prop support, ie defer component loading keeping tree untouched.\n- Usage: Provide `defaults` and use them until sidecar is loaded letting you code split (non visual) render-prop component\n- Analog: - Analog: code split library like [react-imported-library](https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-library) or [@loadable/lib](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/library-splitting/).\n```js\nimport {renderCar, sidecar} from \"use-sidecar\";\nconst RenderCar = renderCar(\n  // will move side car to a side channel\n  sidecar(() => import('react-powerplug').then(imports => imports.Value)),\n  // default render props\n  [{value: 0}]  \n);\n\n<RenderCar>\n  {({value}) => <span>{value}</span>}\n</RenderCar>\n```\n\n## setConfig(config)\n```js\nsetConfig({\n  onError, // sets default error handler\n});\n```\n\n# Examples\n## Deferred effect\nLet's imagine - on element focus you have to do \"something\", for example focus anther element\n\n#### Original code\n```js\nonFocus = event => {\n  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {\n    document.querySelectorAll('button', event.currentTarget)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Sidecar code\n\n3. Use medium (yes, .3)\n```js\n// we are calling medium with an original event as an argument\nconst onFocus = event => focusMedium.useMedium(event);\n```\n2. Define reaction\n```js\n// in a sidecar\n\n// we are setting handler for the effect medium\n// effect is complicated - we are skipping event \"bubbling\", \n// and focusing some button inside a parent\nfocusMedium.assignMedium(event => {\n  if (event.currentTarget === event.target) {\n    document.querySelectorAll('button', event.currentTarget)\n  }\n});\n\n```\n1. Create medium\nHaving these constrains - we have to clone `event`, as long as React would eventually reuse SyntheticEvent, thus not\npreserve `target` and `currentTarget`. \n```js\n// \nconst focusMedium = createMedium(null, event => ({...event}));\n```\nNow medium side effect is ok to be async\n\n__Example__: [Effect for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/Lock.js#L48) - 1kb UI, 4kb sidecar\n\n### Medium callback\nLike a library level code splitting\n\n#### Original code\n```js\nimport {x, y} from './utils';\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (x()) {\n    y()\n  }\n}, []);\n```\n\n#### Sidecar code\n\n```js\n// medium\nconst utilMedium = createMedium();\n\n// utils\nconst x = () => { /* ... */};\nconst y = () => { /* ... */};\n\n// medium will callback with exports exposed\nutilMedium.assignMedium(cb => cb({\n x, y\n}));\n\n\n// UI\n// not importing x and y from the module system, but would be given via callback\nuseEffect(() => {\n  utilMedium.useMedium(({x,y}) => {\n      if (x()) {\n        y()\n      }\n  })\n}, []);\n```\n\n- Hint: there is a easy way to type it\n```js\nconst utilMedium = createMedium<(cb: typeof import('./utils')) => void>();\n``` \n\n__Example__: [Callback API for react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/blob/8c69c644ecfeed2ec9dc0dc4b5b30e896a366738/src/MoveFocusInside.js#L12) \n\n### Split effects\nLets take an example from a Google - Calendar app, with view and logic separated.\nTo be honest - it's not easy to extract logic from application like calendar - usually it's tight coupled.\n\n#### Original code\n```js\nconst CalendarUI = () => { \n  const [date, setDate] = useState();\n  const onButtonClick = useCallback(() => setDate(Date.now), []);\n  \n  return (\n    <>\n     <input type=\"date\" onChange={setDate} value={date} />\n     <input type=\"button\" onClick={onButtonClick}>Set Today</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n#### Sidecar code\n\n```js\nconst CalendarUI = () => {\n  const [events, setEvents] = useState({});\n  const [date, setDate] = useState();\n  \n  return (\n    <>\n     <Sidecar setDate={setDate} setEvents={setEvents}/>\n     <UILayout {...events} date={date}/>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nconst UILayout = ({onDateChange, onButtonClick, date}) => (\n  <>\n      <input type=\"date\" onChange={onDateChange} value={date} />\n      <input type=\"button\" onClick={onButtonClick}>Set Today</button>\n  </>\n);\n\n// in a sidecar\n// we are providing callbacks back to UI\nconst Sidecar = ({setDate, setEvents}) => {\n  useEffect(() => setEvents({\n      onDateChange:setDate,\n      onButtonClick: () => setDate(Date.now),\n  }), []);\n  \n  return null;\n}\n```  \n\nWhile in this example this looks a bit, you know, strange - there are 3 times more code\nthat in the original example - that would make a sense for a real Calendar, especially\nif some helper library, like `moment`, has been used.\n\n__Example__: [Effect for react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll/blob/666472d5c77fb6c4e5beffdde87c53ae63ef42c5/src/SideEffect.tsx#L166) - 300b UI, 2kb sidecar\n\n# Licence\n\nMIT"
